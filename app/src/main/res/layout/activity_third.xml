      android:text="There once was a CS major that stumbled into McDonalds. He was able to buy his 2 large Diet Cokes with no ice, but heard a strange noise that was reminiscent of Elden Ring boss music. Perplexed, he asked the manager about the source of the noise. The manager stated &quot;ah that, that is the source of your drinks&quot;. Even more bewildered, the CS major asked if he could know what it was. The manager stated that if he could drink 20 gallons of Diet Coke at the days end, then he would relenquish the secret. The CS student was able to complete the task easily and informed the manager of the act. &quot;very good&quot; said the manager, &quot;follow me&quot;. The young CS major was lead to a yellow mist that seemed incredibly dense. The manager said &quot;What you seek lies behind this gate, I will accompany you&quot;. Feeling a sense of great honor that seemed to drown out the raging fire of qestions, the unlikely duo enttered. What they found on the other side of the gate.....is still a mystery because you don't drink Diet Coke."
